# Square-Game
A simple game that has a few squares

Note: Please do not run this as administrator, as that has been known to mess some stuff up and the game might not work.

The goal of this game is to get all of the numbers in order in as few moves as possible, or if on zen mode, there is no goal except to mess around with how it works.
